# CVE-Scan
Scan systems with NMap and parse the output to a list of CVE's, CWE's and DPE's

## Goals:
 * Scan a system with NMap or any other scanning tool and use the scan to analyse the systems for vulnerabilities
 * Have the posibility for multiple input formats (NMap scan, xml, Json, etc)
 * Use CVE-Search to enhance the scan to add more information
 * Have multiple export formats as well as webbrowser component
 
### Optional:
* Automatically download known scripts to use on exploits

## Installation:
Warning, this tutorial is for Linux systems (developed and tested on Ubuntu 14.10).
This program should run under Windows (and probably Mac) systems as well.

### Requirements
CVE-Scan uses the CVE-Search API to enhance your nmap scans. You can use [CIRCL](http://circl.lu)s [public API](cve.circle.lu), or install CVE-Search localy.
You can install [CVE-Search](https://github.com/PidgeyL/cve-search) from the git repo.
For now, CVE-Search does not have a "core" package yet (Without the webinterface), but I will add this later on.
Once you installed CVE-Search, in the configuration file, make sure you set the correct URL to it.

CVE-Scan needs some aditional packages to work. Install them using:

```sudo apt-get install -y nmap``` (or your package manager of choice)

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage:
To use CVE-Scan, first run an nmap scan on a system. You can modify the parameters however you want, however, you'd want to include Service Detection and OS detection. Below, you can find a default nmap scan that will output to an xml file.

```nmap -A -O 192.168.0.1 -oX output.xml```

Next, run:

```Python3 Nmap2CVE-Search.py -xN output.xml```

This will start a webserver (default on localhost, port 5050), so browse to http://localhost:5050.

To stop the webserver, just press the ctrl+C combination in the terminal.
